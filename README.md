# Voice-Scramblers
This repository contains various legacy voice scrambling techniques and can be used to scramble or descramble audio files. While the scramblers offer a higher level of security than common voice scrambling methods, they are not cryptographically secure and should not be used to protect sensitive data. Please read the usage file for detailed instructions.
