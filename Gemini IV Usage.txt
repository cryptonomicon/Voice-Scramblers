Gemini IV FFT Voice Scrambler for WAV files


Requirements
Python 3.8+ recommended

Dependencies:
numpy
scipy
librosa
soundfile


To scramble:
gemini4.py --action scramble --input input.wav --output output.wav  --bins 128 --key a1a2a1a2a1a2a1a20123456789abcdef0202020204040b --frame_size 512 --hop_size 128 


To descramble:
gemini4.py --action descramble --input input.wav --output output.wav --bins 128 --key a1a2a1a2a1a2a1a20123456789abcdef0202020204040b --frame_size 512 --hop_size 128 


--action     scramble | descramble
--input      input.wav
--output     output.wav
--bins       64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 (Larger n_bins increases the number of permutations)
--key        up to 48 hex characters (192-bit)
--frame_size default= 512 (The number of samples processed together in each window/frame during spectral analysis.)
--hop size   default= 128 (The number of samples to advance the window for each new frame; determines the overlap between consecutive frames.)


Security

The seed initializes the random permutation of spectral bins for each frame or block of frames, ensuring that the permutation pattern varies across different parts of the audio.  
The seed is generated from a combination of a secret key and a block index (not per-frame). This design guarantees that:  

The permutation pattern changes for each block of frames (e.g., every 16 frames if frames_per_perm=16).
With a frame size of 512 samples and a 16 kHz sampling rate, this results in a seed change approximately every 500 milliseconds.
The permutation pattern is deterministic for the same key and block index, allowing decryption to reproduce the same permutation during unscrambling.
Elementary FFT-based attacks—such as half swaps, rotations, or reversals—are infeasible due to the randomness and complexity of the spectral permutations.
